# Human wellbeing

Technology should nurture, not exploit. Sustainable systems are attentive to human attention, trust, and emotion. They strengthen relationships and reflection instead of eroding them.

Human wellbeing comes to life when we:

- **Design for focus and calm.** Avoid manipulative notifications, dark patterns, and endless feeds that capture attention rather than serving intent.
- **Prioritize mental health and trust.** Create environments where people feel safe, respected, and in control of their experience.
- **Foster meaningful engagement.** Design features that support reflection, community, and creativity instead of distraction and consumption.
- **Reduce cognitive load.** Simplicity, clarity, and empathy make digital experiences more humane.
- **Respect time as a finite resource.** Build tools that help users do what matters and then step away.
