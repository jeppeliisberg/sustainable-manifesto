# Climate before Speed

The principle of Climate before Speed is part of the [Manifesto for Sustainable Software Development](/) created by software developers, designers and entrepreneurs to call for responsibility among our peers to prioritize sustainability — not only in terms of ecological impact but also in inclusivity, ethics, and the long-term resilience of the digital systems we create. By prioritizing Climate over Speed when designing our software, we may contribute to a shift toward a better digital future where technology serves the needs of society, humanity, and the planet — rather than exploiting human psychology for the benefit of a few.

The push for rapid development often prioritizes speed and immediate results over long-term sustainability, resulting in systems that are resource-intensive, energy-inefficient, and environmentally harmful. While prototyping and rapid iteration are valuable for innovation and meeting deadlines, such practices can inadvertently contribute to energy waste, e-waste, and environmental degradation if sustainability is not integrated into the development process.

Early-stage development frequently sacrifices efficiency for speed, an approach that can result in bloated systems requiring significant computational resources and frequent hardware upgrades. Hansen (2019) highlights the importance of designing systems that can operate on older hardware, reducing e-waste and preventing planned obsolescence. Winner (2020) similarly emphasizes the need for energy-efficient design, arguing that the long-term environmental impact of software must be considered alongside its functionality. These ideas align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 12 and SDG 13), which advocate for responsible consumption, production, and climate action.

Prioritizing climate awareness in software development begins with recognizing the environmental costs of rapid technological change. For example, software optimized for the latest hardware often forces users to upgrade their devices, generating unnecessary electronic waste. Systems that rely heavily on centralized data processing or resource-heavy infrastructures, such as inefficient cloud storage, can also drive up energy consumption. These practices have long-term consequences, from increased carbon emissions to unsustainable demand for rare earth materials used in electronic devices.

To address these issues, developers must embed environmental considerations into the design and deployment of software systems. One approach is to optimize software for older hardware, ensuring compatibility with devices that are already in use and extending their lifespan. For instance, lightweight operating systems and applications designed to run efficiently on outdated hardware can reduce the environmental impact of forced upgrades. Minimizing energy consumption through efficient code, streamlined algorithms, and decentralized data processing is another critical step. Technologies like edge computing can reduce reliance on centralized servers, decreasing energy demands and latency.

Sustainable infrastructure is another key area of focus. Hosting systems on renewable-powered servers, optimizing data storage practices, and adopting environmentally conscious hardware choices can significantly reduce a platform's carbon footprint. Open-source software communities often provide excellent examples of lightweight, modular systems that prioritize efficiency over excessive complexity.

Neglecting climate-conscious development practices has far-reaching consequences. The unchecked growth of resource-heavy systems contributes to e-waste, higher carbon emissions, and reliance on unsustainable energy sources. This undermines both environmental sustainability and the long-term viability of software systems. Additionally, users are becoming increasingly aware of the environmental impact of their digital tools, and platforms that fail to address these concerns risk losing user trust and engagement.

Balancing climate awareness with development speed does not mean slowing innovation but rather integrating sustainability into every stage of the development lifecycle. During early stages, designers can explore low-energy alternatives, minimize resource dependencies, and prioritize scalable architectures that accommodate future optimizations. As projects mature, optimization for energy efficiency, hardware longevity, and reduced complexity should become a core focus, ensuring that the system evolves in a sustainable direction.

By choosing climate before speed, software developers and organizations contribute to a more sustainable digital ecosystem. This principle supports both ethical responsibility and long-term growth, ensuring that technological innovation serves not only immediate needs but also the future health of the planet. Incorporating environmental awareness into software design is not just a choice—it is a necessity for creating systems that are resilient, responsible, and aligned with global efforts to address the climate crisis.
