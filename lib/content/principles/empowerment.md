# Empowerment before Convenience

The principle of Empowerment ovbeforeer Convenience is part of the [Manifesto for Sustainable Software Development](/) created by software developers, designers and entrepreneurs to call for responsibility among our peers to prioritize sustainability — not only in terms of ecological impact but also in inclusivity, ethics, and the long-term resilience of the digital systems we create. By prioritizing Empowerment over Convenience when designing our software, we may contribute to a shift toward a better digital future where technology serves the needs of society, humanity, and the planet — rather than exploiting human psychology for the benefit of a few.

Convenience is a powerful motivator in the design of digital systems, offering seamless onboarding, ease of use, and streamlined experiences. However, prioritizing convenience—especially for vendors—often comes at the cost of user empowerment. When users are locked into proprietary ecosystems, they lose control over their data, choices, and ability to adapt to changing needs. Empowerment ensures users retain autonomy and the freedom to move between systems, fostering innovation, trust, and resilience in the digital ecosystem.

While convenience has value, it can also lead to monopolistic dynamics that stifle competition and exacerbate inequality. Systems designed around vendor convenience often lock users into proprietary formats or services, making it difficult—or even impossible—for them to migrate their data or integrate with other platforms. This dynamic consolidates power within a few dominant companies, reducing market diversity and leading to suboptimal user experiences over time. By contrast, empowering users through open standards, data portability, and decentralized approaches aligns with the ideals of healthy competition often associated with capitalism. True capitalism thrives on competition, and systems that enable user freedom promote this principle by preventing monopolies and encouraging diversity in the marketplace.

Empowerment before convenience is not an anti-capitalist stance; rather, it reclaims the essence of fair competition and equitable markets. These principles do not prevent companies from making money. Instead, they ensure that growth is sustainable, ethical, and beneficial to both users and the broader ecosystem. By avoiding monopolistic practices, companies can focus on creating better products and services to retain users rather than relying on lock-in or restrictive practices.

Designing for empowerment means prioritizing user autonomy over the operational simplicity of centralized systems. Open standards are foundational to this approach, enabling systems to work seamlessly across platforms and giving users the freedom to choose tools that best meet their needs. Data portability is equally critical, ensuring users can easily transfer their information to other systems without being trapped in a single ecosystem. Decentralized models take empowerment a step further by distributing control and decision-making, reducing reliance on a single entity and fostering trust through shared governance.

Examples of empowered design include platforms that allow users to export their data in standardized formats for easy migration, systems with open APIs that support interoperability, and decentralized tools that give users control over their data and identities. For instance, community software that supports alternative interfaces like email or SMS ensures participation for those without access to smartphones or high-speed internet, demonstrating how inclusivity and empowerment can intersect to create more equitable systems.

Failure to prioritize empowerment results in ecosystems dominated by a few players, leading to reduced innovation, poorer user experiences, and increasing inequality. As monopolistic practices grow unchecked, users lose the ability to make meaningful choices, and competition dwindles. This erosion of diversity in the marketplace ultimately harms consumers and companies alike, as fewer players mean less incentive to improve products or address user needs.

Empowerment also has broader societal implications. By ensuring users can control their data and access diverse tools, systems can reduce the concentration of power and wealth in a few entities, promoting greater equity and opportunity. These principles align with ideals of fairness and accountability, fostering trust in technology and its creators.

To implement empowerment effectively, designers and entrepreneurs must adopt practices that prioritize user freedom and competition. Open standards and interoperable systems should be default choices, ensuring users have the flexibility to switch tools or integrate with new technologies. Data portability must be built into systems from the start, with transparent policies that give users full control over their information. Decentralized governance models, where feasible, can further reduce reliance on centralized authority and build user trust.

By embracing empowerment before convenience, companies can create sustainable ecosystems that benefit everyone: users gain freedom and autonomy, the market remains diverse and competitive, and businesses can thrive without resorting to exploitative practices. This principle not only upholds ethical values but also redefines growth as a shared endeavor, where success is measured not by monopolistic control but by the strength of the community it serves.
