# Collaborative development

Sustainability is a process, not a destination. Collaborative development allows communities to see progress, question assumptions, and contribute to continuous improvement. Iteration ensures that our systems can evolve alongside our understanding.

Collaborative development comes to life when we:

- **Share goals and progress openly.** Publish sustainability targets, metrics, and learnings so others can build on them.
- **Invite critique and collaboration.** Openness to feedback makes improvement possible and trust durable.
- **Measure what matters.** Evaluate social, environmental, and technical outcomes regularly, not just financial ones.
- **Adapt based on evidence.** Treat iteration as a responsibility and update practices as knowledge and context evolve.
- **Keep sustainability visible.** Make the ongoing process part of the culture, not a one-time declaration.
