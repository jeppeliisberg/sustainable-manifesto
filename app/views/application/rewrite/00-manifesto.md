# Manifesto for sustainable software

Software shapes the world we live in. It powers communication, education, commerce, and culture. But it also consumes vast amounts of energy, accelerates extraction, concentrates power, and often undermines the trust and wellbeing of communities.

The systems we create are never neutral. They can magnify harm, or they can strengthen the foundations of a just and sustainable society. How we build today shapes what becomes possible tomorrow.

This manifesto is our commitment to the latter. It calls on creators, maintainers, organizations, and citizens to align digital systems with the needs of a thriving world. Sustainable software is not a luxury, but an essential part of our shared future.

## Principles

### Lower environmental impact

Every line of code has a footprint. The energy we consume, the servers we power, and the materials we depend on shape the planet’s health. Sustainable software minimizes harm and aligns our digital systems with ecological limits.

### Enduring design

Software that endures helps both people and the planet. When systems are designed to last, they reduce exclusion, limit waste, and remain usable across devices and contexts. Efficiency ensures that resources, like energy and attention, are not squandered.

### Human wellbeing

Technology should nurture, not exploit. Sustainable systems are attentive to human attention, trust, and emotion. They strengthen relationships and reflection instead of eroding them.

### Inclusive creation

Technology serves humanity best when it welcomes everyone. Inclusive systems adapt to diverse abilities, languages, and contexts. Building literacy means helping people understand not only how technology works, but also its impact on their lives and environment.

### Data sovereignty

Data is not a resource to be mined. It represents people’s lives and choice and, as such, it belongs to them. Respecting privacy means respecting autonomy and trust. Sustainable systems give individuals real control over their data and minimize what is collected in the first place.

### Accountable algorithms

Algorithms influence opportunity, representation, and truth. Their impact must be understandable and open to challenge. Accountability means taking responsibility for how automated systems shape society, while clarity ensures that people can grasp and question the reasoning behind decisions that affect them.

### Fair labour

Technology does not stand apart from the economy that supports it. Sustainable systems depend on fair labour, ethical business models, and shared value creation. A just digital economy is one where those who contribute are recognized and rewarded.

### Open infrastructure

Open systems are adaptable systems. They invite participation, foster transparency, and distribute power. Resilience ensures that these systems can endure technical, social, or environmental shocks without breaking trust or continuity.

### Transparent development

Sustainability is a process, not a destination. Transparent practices allow communities to see progress, question assumptions, and contribute to continuous improvement. Iteration ensures that our systems can evolve alongside our understanding.

### Governance for the common good

Technology shapes the conditions of collective life. Governance defines who holds power, who benefits, and who bears the risks. Sustainable software is guided by shared stewardship and decision-making that prioritizes the public good.
