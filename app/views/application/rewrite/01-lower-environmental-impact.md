# Lower environmental impact

Every line of code has a footprint. The energy we consume, the servers we power, and the materials we depend on shape the planetâ€™s health. Sustainable software minimizes harm and aligns our digital systems with ecological limits.

Lower environmental impact comes to life when we:

- **Measure the impact of our choices.** Understand and track the carbon, energy, and material costs of the systems we build to make sustainability visible and actionable.
- **Design for efficiency, not excess.** Reduce computational load, data transfer, and storage waste wherever possible without compromising usability or quality.
- **Choose infrastructure responsibly.** Prefer hosting and services that use renewable energy and commit to transparent sustainability reporting.
- **Encourage low-impact behaviors.** Make it easy for users to make environmentally conscious choices through defaults, design, and education.
- **Plan for the full lifecycle.** Consider maintenance, updates, and eventual decommissioning from the start to minimize long-term waste.
