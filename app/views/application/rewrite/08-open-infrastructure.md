# Open infrastructure

Open systems are adaptable systems. They invite participation, foster transparency, and distribute power. Resilience ensures that these systems can endure technical, social, or environmental shocks without breaking trust or continuity.

Open infrastructure comes to life when we:

- **Adopt open standards and protocols.** Interoperability strengthens collaboration and reduces dependence on closed ecosystems.
- **Foster open governance.** Encourage diverse stakeholders to contribute to and guide shared infrastructure.
- **Design for redundancy.** Ensure systems can recover gracefully from failure and remain functional under pressure.
- **Encourage shared ownership.** Build communities of maintainers, contributors, and users who care for the same system.
- **Publish openly.** Share code, documentation, and decisions so others can learn, reuse, and build upon them.
