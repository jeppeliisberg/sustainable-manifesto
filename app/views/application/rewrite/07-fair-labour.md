# Fair labour

Technology does not stand apart from the economy that supports it. Sustainable systems depend on fair labour, ethical business models, and shared value creation. A just digital economy is one where those who contribute are recognized and rewarded.

Fair labour comes to life when we:

- **Ensure fair pay and safe conditions.** From developers to data labelers, everyone who sustains a system deserves equitable treatment.
- **Distribute value fairly.** Avoid extractive business models that concentrate wealth and power while externalizing costs.
- **Support sustainable funding.** Choose models that balance profit with reinvestment in community and maintenance.
- **Recognize invisible work.** Acknowledge and support the emotional, social, and volunteer labour that keeps ecosystems alive.
- **Build cooperative ecosystems.** Favor partnerships and ownership structures that align incentives with collective wellbeing.
