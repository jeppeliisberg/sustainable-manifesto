# Governance for the common good

Technology shapes the conditions of collective life. Governance defines who holds power, who benefits, and who bears the risks. Sustainable software is guided by shared stewardship and decision-making that prioritizes the public good.

Governance for the common good comes to life when we:

- **Include those most affected.** Decisions should reflect the voices of users, workers, and communities impacted by technology.
- **Practice participatory governance.** Use transparent, democratic methods to guide priorities and resolve conflicts.
- **Design for accountability.** Make power visible and challengeable within organizational and technical structures.
- **Foster long-term stewardship.** Foster long-term stewardship. Encourage caretakers, not just owners, who think in decades rather than quarters.
- **Align governance with values.** Ensure that sustainability, justice, and wellbeing remain the compass for every decision.
