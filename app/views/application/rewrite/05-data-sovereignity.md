# Data soverignty

Data is not a resource to be mined — it is a trace of people’s lives. Respecting privacy means respecting autonomy and trust. Sustainable systems give individuals real control over their data and minimize what is collected in the first place.

Data sovereignty comes to life when we:

- **Collect only what is essential.** Reduce data collection to the minimum needed for functionality, and avoid surveillance as a default.
- **Return control to users.** Make it easy for people to access, edit, move, or delete their data at any time.
- **Protect data at every stage.** Use encryption, strong access controls, and transparent governance to safeguard personal information.
- **Design with consent at the core.** Ask clearly, explain why data is needed, and make refusal an equal and respected choice.
- **Support data portability and sovereignty.** Enable users and communities to host, manage, or relocate their data under their own terms.
