# Accountable algorithms

Algorithms influence opportunity, representation, and truth. Their impact must be understandable and open to challenge. Accountability means taking responsibility for how automated systems shape society, while clarity ensures that people can grasp and question the reasoning behind decisions that affect them.

Accountable algorithms come to life when we:

- **Make systems understandable.** Provide clear, accessible explanations of what an algorithm does, what data it uses, and how outcomes are determined.
- **Expose decisions to scrutiny.** Enable independent testing, auditing, and feedback from those affected by automated processes.
- **Mitigate bias continuously.** Examine datasets, models, and outcomes to detect and correct unfairness in both design and deployment.
- **Ensure human oversight.** Keep people in the loop for meaningful decisions, with the authority to intervene or override automated results.
- **Provide channels for recourse.** When harm or error occurs, ensure there are transparent, fair, and responsive ways to contest and correct it.
