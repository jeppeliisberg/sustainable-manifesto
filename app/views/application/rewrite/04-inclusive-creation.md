# Inclusive creation

Technology serves humanity best when it welcomes everyone. Inclusive systems adapt to diverse abilities, languages, and contexts. Building literacy means helping people understand not only how technology works, but also its impact on their lives and environment.

Inclusive creation comes to life when we:

- **Design for accessibility from the start.** Accessibility is not an add-on but a foundation. Ensure interfaces and content are usable by all.
- **Support diverse contexts.** Build for low-bandwidth environments, shared devices, and varied hardware to broaden participation.
- **Value language diversity.** Offer multilingual experiences and avoid assuming English as a default.
- **Share knowledge openly.** Provide education and documentation that demystify technology and empower users to make informed choices.
- **Foster digital literacy.** Help communities understand how systems affect their rights, wellbeing, and the planet.
