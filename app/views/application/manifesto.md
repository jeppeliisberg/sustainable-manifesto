# Manifesto for sustainable software

## Intro

Software shapes the world we live in. It powers communication, education, commerce, and culture. But it also consumes vast amounts of energy, accelerates extraction, concentrates power, and often undermines the trust and wellbeing of communities.  

The systems we create are never neutral. They can magnify harm, or they can strengthen the foundations of a just and sustainable society. How we build today shapes what becomes possible tomorrow.  

This manifesto is our commitment to the latter. It calls on creators, maintainers, organizations, and citizens to align digital systems with the needs of a thriving world. Sustainable software is not a luxury — it is essential to our shared future.  

## Principles

### 1. Longevity and efficiency

Software endures when it works across generations of devices, avoids excess, and wastes no resources. Longevity reduces e-waste and exclusion, widening access while lightening the planet’s load.  

### 2. Lower environmental impact

Energy, carbon, and material footprints are part of every technical choice. Our work reduces harm and aligns digital systems with the needs of a living planet.  

### 3. Privacy and data sovereignty

Data belongs to people. We collect less, return control, and guarantee the right to move, delete, or protect personal information.  

### 4. Inclusion and literacy

Technology welcomes everyone when it is accessible, multilingual, and usable in low-bandwidth or constrained contexts. We also share knowledge openly, building awareness of impacts so people can choose wisely.  

### 5. Human wellbeing

Attention is precious. We reject manipulative patterns that exploit it, and create experiences that cultivate trust, reflection, and meaningful engagement.  

### 6. Openness and resilience

Open standards and interoperable protocols strengthen systems. Decentralization and redundancy ensure they endure disruptions. Together, openness and resilience make technology more just and future-proof.  

### 7. Algorithm transparency and accountability

Automated systems influence decisions, opportunities, and perspectives. They are understandable, open to scrutiny, and responsive when challenged.  

### 8. Fair work and fair economy

Technology does not stand apart from the economy that supports it. We uphold fair labour practices and revenue models that reward contributors, sustain communities, and avoid exploitation. A just digital economy is part of true sustainability.

### 9. Transparency and iteration

Sustainability is never finished. We publish goals, measure impact, invite critique, and evolve with our communities.  

### 10. Governance for the common good

Decision-making belongs to those most affected. We practice participatory governance and stewardship that prioritizes collective wellbeing over short-term gain.
