# Manifesto for sustainable software

## Intro

Software shapes the world we live in. It powers communication, education, commerce, and culture. But it also consumes vast amounts of energy, accelerates extraction, concentrates power, and often undermines the trust and wellbeing of communities.  

The systems we create are never neutral. They can magnify harm, or they can strengthen the foundations of a just and sustainable society. How we build today shapes what becomes possible tomorrow.  

This manifesto is our commitment to the latter. It calls on creators, maintainers, organisations, and citizens to align digital systems with the needs of a thriving world. Sustainable software is not a luxury — it is essential to our shared future.  

## Principles

### We commit to longevity and efficiency

Software endures when it works across generations of devices, avoids excess, and wastes no resources. Longevity reduces e-waste and exclusion, widening access while lightening the planet’s load.  

### We commit to lowering environmental impact

Energy, carbon, and material footprints are part of every technical choice. Our work reduces harm and aligns digital systems with the needs of a living planet.  

### We commit to privacy and data sovereignty

Data belongs to people. We collect less, return control, and guarantee the right to move, delete, or protect personal information.  

### We commit to inclusion and literacy

Technology welcomes everyone when it is accessible, multilingual, and usable in low-bandwidth or constrained contexts. We also share knowledge openly, building awareness of impacts so people can choose wisely.  

### We commit to human wellbeing

Attention is precious. We reject manipulative patterns that exploit it, and create experiences that cultivate trust, reflection, and meaningful engagement.  

### We commit to openness and resilience

Open standards and interoperable protocols strengthen systems. Decentralisation and redundancy ensure they endure disruptions. Together, openness and resilience make technology more just and future-proof.  

### We commit to transparency and accountability in algorithms

Automated systems influence decisions, opportunities, and perspectives. They are understandable, open to scrutiny, and responsive when challenged.  

### We commit to fairness in labour and value

Technology is sustained by people. We uphold fair pay, safe working conditions, and models that distribute benefits instead of extracting them.  

### We commit to transparency and iteration

Sustainability is never finished. We publish goals, measure impact, invite critique, and evolve with our communities.  

### We commit to governance for the common good.
Decision-making belongs to those most affected. We practise participatory governance and stewardship that prioritises collective wellbeing over short-term gain.
